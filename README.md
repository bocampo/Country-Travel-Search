# Country Travel Search

Our team created a web service for searching countries for travel using the following criteria:

```md
As a user, I want to be able to sign into a webpage meant for searching for countries for travel
As a user, I want to search for country names to view information for travel.
As a user, I want to be able to save countries I wish to visit on a list.
As a user, I want to be able to delete countries from my saved list that I no longer interested in.
```

Our project makes use of the following technologies:

```md
Node.js
Express.js
Handlebars
PostgreSQL
Sequelize ORM
GET / POST routes
```

Below are images of the deployed webpage.
